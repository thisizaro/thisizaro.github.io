# CICFlowmeter API (Dockerized)

## Overview

This project provides a **REST API wrapper** around [**CICFlowMeter**](https://github.com/CanadianInstituteForCybersecurity/CICFlowMeter) using **FastAPI** and **Docker**.

The API accepts a **PCAP file**, processes it using CICFlowMeter inside a Docker container, and returns the generated **CSV flow files as a ZIP archive**.

This setup is designed to:

- Be easy to run
- Be reproducible using Docker
- Work with large PCAP files
- Keep the Java/Gradle logic isolated from the API layer

---

## How It Works (High Level)

1. Client uploads a PCAP file via API
2. PCAP is saved to `/pcap` inside the container
3. CICFlowMeter is executed using Gradle
4. CSV flow files are generated in `/flow`
5. All CSVs are zipped
6. ZIP file is returned to the client

Only **one request is processed at a time**.

## Requirements

- Docker (Docker Desktop recommended)
- No local Java, Gradle, or Python setup required

---

## Build the Docker Image

From the project root:

```bash
docker build -t cicflow-api .
```

---

## Run the API

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 --name cicflow-api-container cicflow-api
```

Once running, the API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## API Documentation (Swagger UI)

FastAPI automatically provides interactive documentation:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Use this page to:

- Upload a PCAP file
- Test the API directly from the browser

---

## API Endpoint

### `POST /process`

**Description:**
Uploads a PCAP file, processes it, and returns flow CSV files as a ZIP.

**Request:**

- `multipart/form-data`
- Single file upload (`.pcap`)

**Response:**

- `application/zip`
- Contains CSV flow files

---

## Notes & Assumptions

- Only one API request is processed at a time
- Temporary cleanup is minimal (PCAP files are removed after processing)
- This project currently runs entirely inside a Docker container
- Designed for experimentation and research use
